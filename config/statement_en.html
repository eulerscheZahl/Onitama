        Onitama is played on a <const>5</const>x<const>5</const> board. Each player has <const>1</const> master and <const>4</const> students.
        The players have to protect a shrine, which is at the starting cell of their master. The game will end as a tie, if no player succeeds within <const>200</const> turns.<br><br>
        <strong>Cards</strong><br>
        Each player has <const>2</const> cards. A 5th card is in between both players. When a player uses one of his cards, he places it in the center and gets the other card from the center in return. <br>
        A card gives a set of <const>2</const> to <const>4</const> possible move actions. <br>
        The card placed in the center will be rotated by 180 degrees. This gives each move a direction such as "forward", which translates to "up" or "down" depending on the player.
         <br> <br>
        <strong>Moving units</strong><br>
        To move a unit, a player select one of his cards. He then chooses a move pattern defined by the card and applies it to a figure of his choice. <br>
        The destination field must either be free or occupied by an opponent. The opponent on that cell will than get eliminated from the game. <br>
        If there is no valid move, a player can <action>PASS</action> a card of his choice, effectively changing it with the center card without moving any unit.
